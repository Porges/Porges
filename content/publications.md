I would not call myself _published_, but this page collects together various bits and pieces of named & dated media.

### (2023) “An Occult History of Computing”

Presented at [Code Camp Wellington](https://www.codecampwellington.nz/2023/). A history of computing through the lens of magic. 

> **Summary**: Is computing magic? Are there connections with the occult in the history of computing? What does it mean when we talk about computers as magic or programmers as wizards?

> **Bio**: Neither an occultist nor a historian, I've worked as a software engineer entirely remotely for over nine years. This is enough time to develop many _Alone Thoughts_, which I hope to share with you. My interests run the gamut of software development. My work history is in building and running software services at scale, although I have recently moved into breaking them (offensive research). I'm deeply interested in the humanistic aspects of software and attempting to empower rather than disempower users.

Not recorded but I hope to repurpose this into a recorded video or article(s) at some point.
