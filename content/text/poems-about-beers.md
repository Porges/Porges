### Steinlager

First sip: I am fishing from a dinghy,<br>Bobbing in the ocean

Two: the sea is still<br>The wind is quiet

Three: I have caught a fish<br>I drop it in the bottom of the boat<br>Seawater around my ankles

Four: I lift the vessel<br>fish afloat, gunwales-to-lips<br>and drink

Notes: rust, salt.

### Ranfurly

When I drink a Ranfurly,<br>I have never felt so Manfurly.
