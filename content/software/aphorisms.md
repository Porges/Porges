Something that has worked well for me several times (twice so far) is coming up with a catchy aphorism and then getting other people to write about it.

I need to try this again.

### implementations, not representations

Turned into the article “[Pass implementations, not representations](https://www.nichesoftware.co.nz/2017/10/14/representation-vs-implementation.html)” (2017) by Bevan Arps. 

### parse, don’t validate

[This](https://web.archive.org/web/20220717204533/https://twitter.com/porges/status/1182355121457385472) was turned into the wonderful “[Parse, don’t validate](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/)” (2019) by Alexis King. It’s much better than anything I could (or can) have written on the subject.^[The original thing I was working on writing back in 2017 (“a type for every concept”) I never actually got around to publishing at the time. But there’s a hint of this in the [early draft](https://github.com/Porges/Porges/commit/637feafd48b57e48eae96af8743f532b36de9d0e#:~:text=Also%2C%20prefer%20normalization%20to%20simple%20validation.).]
