title: Welcome

This is the <em>n</em>th, and maybe final (ha!), iteration of my personal website. (I am not related to [George Pollard,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Pollard_Jr.) the captain of the ill-fated whaleship <cite>Essex</cite>, but I have read <cite>Moby Dick</cite>.)

This time around my personal site takes the form of a collection of notes rather than attempting (and failing) to function as a blog.


Some entry points:

- [[interests|My (Current) Interests]]
- [[publications|My (Few) Publications]]

## Elsewhere

My other sites are:

- [Ways to Play](https://games.porg.es/), a site about traditional board and card games

You can also find me on:

- Bluesky: [@porg.es](https://bsky.app/profile/porg.es)
- [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4220815-george-pollard)
- Mastodon: [@porges@toot.cafe](https://toot.cafe/@porges)
  - note that I do not check this very often

### Previously

I was previously on these sites but no longer use them:

- Twitter: [@porges](https://twitter.com/porges)
