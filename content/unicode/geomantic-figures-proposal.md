This is a Unicode proposal to encode the Geomantic Figures. The Unicode document reference is [L2/23-218](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2023/23218-geomancy.pdf).

This was my first Unicode proposal and my experience of submitting it was very smooth. 

The timeline of my submission, if it is of interest to other potential proposal authors, looked like this:
- June 2023: submitted to the Unicode Script Ad-Hoc Group
- 18th August 2023: reviewed by Script Ad-Hoc
- 28th August 2023: received feedback from SAH
- 4th September 2023: updated submission after feedback
- 15th September 2023: re-reviewed by SAH, agreed to recommend to UTC (informed me 20th Sep)
- 2nd November 2023: UTC meeting #177 day 2, UTC [agreed to provisionally assign the characters](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2023/23231.htm#177-C34:~:text=Provisionally%20assign%2016%20code%20points%20U%2B1CEE0..U%2B1CEEF%20for%20geomantic%20figures) (informed me 4th Nov)

The characters are currently in the [Proposed New Characters](https://www.unicode.org/alloc/Pipeline.html) pipeline.
