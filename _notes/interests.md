A short list of things I’m interested in.

## Games, traditional, board & card

I collect playing cards and also games — as in, rules for them.

My main site about games is [Ways to Play.](https://games.porges) For cards, I focus mainly on (East/South-East) Asian decks as they have been underrepresented in existing books and I would like to correct that:

- See [the articles on Hanafuda](https://games.porg.es/articles/cards/japan/hanafuda/) for more on Japanese cards.
- The [Chinese card](https://games.porg.es/articles/cards/china/) articles are mostly yet to be written.
- There is some information about the [Ceki deck](https://games.porg.es/articles/cards/ceki/) used in Malaysia/Singapore and Indonesia.

## Languages & Unicode

I am by no means a linguist — and am mostly monolingual — but languages are rather key to many of these other interests so linguistic things pop up all over the place.
## Programming & Software

I like tools and techniques with [[high leverage]]. For developing software at any kind of multiple-source-file scale, to me this means static typing.
