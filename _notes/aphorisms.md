Something that has worked well for me several times (twice so far) is coming up with a catchy aphorism and then getting other people to write about it.

I need to try this again.
### implementations, not representations

Turned into the article “[Pass implementations, not representations](https://www.nichesoftware.co.nz/2017/10/14/representation-vs-implementation.html)” (2017) by Bevan Arps. 
### parse, don’t validate

[This](https://web.archive.org/web/20220717204556/https://twitter.com/porges/status/931305154372161536) was turned into the wonderful “[Parse, don’t validate](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/)” (2019) by Alexis King.
